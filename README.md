# gruvdark

> This is a color scheme for vim/nvim.

## Origin

- This color scheme is inspired by [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox), [gruvbox8](https://github.com/lifepillar/vim-gruvbox8) and [gruvbit](https://github.com/habamax/vim-gruvbit);
- This color scheme is generated by [vim-colortemplate](https://github.com/lifepillar/vim-colortemplate);

## Features

- Refined for higher contrast, feels a little diffrent from the origin gruvbox, but still very harmonious;
- Well tuned integrated color groups, for both `gui` and `256`;
- Well tuned to work with the integrated tools such as explorer `Netrw`, `statusline` and `tabline`;
- Very lean, no color group for any specific language or plugins, but was well tuned to work with [vim-polyglot](https://github.com/sheerun/vim-polyglot);

## Installation

- Use any plugin installation methods for vim/nvim;
- Add the following code to your vim runtime like `.vimrc`:

```bash
set t_Co=256
set termguicolors
set background=dark
colorscheme gruvdark
```
